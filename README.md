Key Features & Insights

The Exec- Dashboard, which is specially designed for the Top-level management team, who wants to see the financial health of the company and KPIs, High-level Trending (e.g. Profit.). 

You can see how data is changing according to “the Orders by Category Bar chart” from the right-hand side of the report. 

MAP is designed to compare regional performance, to look at which country is doing better and which is not. You can understand by seeing the Bubble Size (the bigger it is, the better one). 

In the Product Detail View (Managerial Level Report): 
 We can forecast the profit (Profit-maximization) according to the price adjustment ( there are two Lines in a Line chart, one is for the Current Profit, and another one is for Adjusted Profit). 
You can see the Report Summary (how much it has increased by Profit) according to the Selected Product in the above-left corner (which you can select from the Exec- Dashboard by from the Top 10 Products then Drill Through). 
And the three gauge Charts are for understanding whether we met our target ( in Orders, Revenue, and Revenue).

Customer Detail View: 
The top one customer (right-hand side of the report) will be changing according to the customer's Income, Occupation (which can be selected from the left Pie Chart), as well according to the year you have selected (Note: when you see multiple customers on the TOP ONE CUSTOMER, then please look at the table just on the left-hand side, you can understand that all customers on that period ordered in the same amount of products.)
This report also has a Line Chart on the above, which is to have an idea about Total Customer, and Revenue Per Customer. It’s better to see according to the Year, however, it can be also filtered down what I have mentioned above.

For the Q&A View: You can ask questions ( like Return Rate by Product name (e.g. Bike), Overall profit, or Return Rate by Category etc.)
*Note: It has limited keywords to answer your question, because it’s an AI tool, and I have trained according to our Client base.
It feels so good when we are done with all the steps to create a Power BI model, and then just ask AI to answer questions.

For the Decomposition Tree: You need to optimize data within the Visual, but it’s really helpful to understand the performance of the products.

For the Key Influencer Tab: You need to be creative here as well, it can help you to find the top client of your business. (for example here, you can see how the Home Owner is changing according to their profession, income, education level, parent, marital status, or gender)
